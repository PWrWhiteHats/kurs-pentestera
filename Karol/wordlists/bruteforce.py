# This code is meant to generate all possible combinations of 6 characters
# The possible combinations are generated by combining all lowercase, uppercase,
# numbers, and special characters. The combinations are then printed.

# String constants for all lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters

# String containing all possible characters

# List of all possible combinations of 6 characters
possible = list(combinations(all, 6))

# Print the size of the list
